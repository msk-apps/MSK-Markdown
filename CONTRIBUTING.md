# How to contribute?

First of all, thank you for contributing to this project. We are trying to make this a stable project by fixing bugs and adding new features continuously. You can help us do more.

# How to create a good issue?

Issues are usually bug reports, feature requests, or documentation improvements.

Please check if there is already a [same issue](https://github.com/msk-apps/msk-markdown/issues) before submitting yours.

If there is an old *same* issue that is closed, feel free to create a new one. Make sure to review why the original issue got closed to avoid your issue getting closed as well.

If there are no existing issues, it is absolutely okay to open one! But we highly recommend using the GitHub issue templates we made to describe your issue.

Issues should contain a clear and concise description of the issue, a screenshot of the problem, and device information, if applicable.

Don't ping or add comments to bring attention to your issue. Please be patient until a contributor or maintainer decides to work on your issue.

**Spam issues aren't allowed for any reason.**

# How to create a good pull request?

Please create an issue or GitHub discussion before opening a pull request to discuss the new feature with the community, contributors, and maintainers to see if the feature is applicable for implementation or not.

If the pull request fixes an issue that is *already discussed*, feel free to open it!

We recommend using the PR templates that we made instead of creating a blank one.

If the pull request is related to an issue, please mention the issue using the following format:

```
Fixes #123
Resolves #123

(123 is the issue number)
```

And also, a clear and concise description of what the pull request does or fixes.

Don't ping or add additional comments to bring attention to your pull request. Please be patient until a maintainer reviews and decides to merge the pull request.

We recommend that pull requests push to the [`dev`](https://github.com/msk-apps/msk-markdown/tree/dev) branch. When there are multiple pull requests ready for merge, they will be merged to the `master` branch and will be deployed online automatically.

Please push to the `dev` branch to avoid merge conflicts with other PRs and automatic deploys.

**Spam pull requests aren't allowed for any reason.**

# How to create useful GitHub discussions?

GitHub discussions are used for announcements (under the "Announcements" category). Questions about the project (under the "Q&A" category).

If you have a good idea, feel free to share it under the "Idea" category! 

All GitHub discussions should follow [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines).

**Spam discussions aren't allowed for any reason.**
